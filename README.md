# sitestatus-mobile

## Local Setup

1. Clone this repo.
2. In terminal, browse to the the directory you cloned this repo to. Probably something like: `cd Repos`, `cd sitestatus-mobile`. You want to be in the root directory for the repo. In it you'll have a readme file and a folder called "sitestatus".
3. Run: `npm install -g cordova ionic`.
4. Browse into the sitestatus folder. Should be `cd sitestatus`.
5. Run `ionic emulate ios`. You might have to build first, in which case run `ionic build ios`, but I don`t think so. In order for this to work, you`re going to need to have [X Code](https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiBlM2c0PXOAhUM6IMKHfI4CFkQFggmMAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fca%2Fapp%2Fxcode%2Fid497799835%3Fmt%3D12&usg=AFQjCNEcW4A3MlwpoiDwzM_kgEKQ55li6A) installed (because it uses the X Code emulator).

## Working with Project
More to come here, but the template files are in: `wwww/templates/`. We're starting with the Ionic "tabs" starter project, which I think is a good starting point, but we are going to need to learn how to do things. The "Chats" tab may be a good starting point, maybe.
